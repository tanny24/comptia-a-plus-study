# 📚 CompTIA A+ Daily Study Streak

This repo tracks my daily study for CompTIA A+.  
Goal: 15+ min/day + one commit → keep the streak alive. ✅

---

## How it works
- `journal/YYYY/MM-DD.md` → daily log entries  
- `templates/day-template.md` → blank starter for each log  
- `scripts/` → scripts to auto-create today’s file  
- `.github/workflows/` → reminders + streak checker (optional)  

---

## Quick Start
1. Run the script for today’s entry.  
2. Write notes (topics, recall bullets, tomorrow’s target).  
3. Commit + push → green square on the graph.  

---

## Habit Rules
- **Minimum**: 15 minutes focused study + one commit  
- **Acceptable**: journal updates, flashcard tweaks, checklist edits  
- **Not acceptable**: empty/no-op commits  
- **If you miss**: mark it, move on, keep the streak alive tomorrow

✍️ Keep it simple: show up, log it, push it.
